### rmathewjf

Hi, I am <strong>Mathew</strong> (no exclamation mark; I do not possess that kind of energy).
I am currently on my third year studying BSCS.

I usually spend my whole day in front of my computer studying.
Presently, I am studying <strong>Vue</strong> and working on my personal projects and portfolio (which I hope would help me land an internship on the company I've been eyeing).
Once I have the time, knowledge, and confidence, I'm going to work on or contribute to some F/OSS projects.

### About me

 üêß I like using free and/or open-source software.

üóÑÔ∏è I like keeping things organized.
